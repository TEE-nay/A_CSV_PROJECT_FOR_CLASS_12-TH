THESE COULD BE THE FOLLOWING ERROR THAT YOU COULD FACE DURING THE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM 

--MODULE ERROR--

1) NO CSV
2) NO PANDAS
3) NO COLORAMA

THE CODE TO FIX THEM ARE GIVEN HERE RESPECTIVLY:

      pip install python-csv
      pip install pandas
      pip install colorama

--Logic error--

if you do not understand the logic, well firstly then be more attentive in classes and shit.
Secondly, do not play along in the functions part, just tweak the name a little bit if you want to.
And if you are not sure, then do not attempt anything, except changing  **your ** name inside the file.
